    title: "Agility at Scale"
    about: "A common view is that scaling Agile is a change for teams only. Therefore, the focus is primarily on changing development teams, while the system of management, the organisational structure and policies remain the same.
At the heart of agile organizations are self-managing teams that solve client needs. This is radically different than the standard way of organizing teams, where teams deliver only a small part of the clients’ needs. Management faces the task to redesign the organization so that agility at scale becomes possible. Typically this means:

Organizing around your product to optimize for solving customer needs.
Developing teams that are able to deliver products that meet business objectives and market needs.
Moving to a management system that values adaptability and learning over control and predictability.
Scaling Scrum requires more than improving at the team level, it requires focus to  optimize the whole of product development. From my point of view the question organizations should ask is:

How can we change and simplify the organizational design to become really Agile instead of putting Agile famethods on top of the current structures?

    title: "The Language of Outcomes"
    about: "For the past 20 years, the Agile community has been trying to improve the world of work. However, while working in new ways, we continue to use the old language. For example, we talk about product/sprint backlogs and ceremonies, and “…doing twice the work in half the time”. It is hardly surprising then to hear the people we have been supporting on their change journey say that it’s all the same as before.

We should change this perception by learning and using the language of outcomes to consistently remind ourselves, as individuals, teams and organisations, why we are here, what our purpose is and what we are trying to achieve. From our purpose, to outcomes, fresh insights, and back again - we will introduce to you “Wholehearted Delivery”. The model consists of three complementary perspectives: creation of value, enhancing fitness and alignment with purpose. We look forward to your input to help us evolve our model and make it more useful."

    title: "Cost Of Delay"
    about: "Generally we want to control things. We want to know how long things will take and how much effort will be needed. There are ways how to achieve that - we lock architect in a room and he comes with results. He’s the expert! Just for any case we put 20% contingency on top to be safe. And then negotiate down the price to fit the budget. Later PM makes a plan what to do in what order, calls it project and team starts work. Simple, isn’t it? That’s what everyone does, so it should be correct...
We’ll look into classical estimation and planning techniques and why they don’t work. We’ll investigate why all projects fail and look into musings of one of Agile fathers, Donald G. Reinertsen, and his approach to so called Cost of Delay. We need to talk about projects versus products as well. Finally, You’ll get a chance to try this  out by yourself and have some fun!"

- Local optimization results in global sub-optimization.

Sounds interesting and not so intuitive, isn't it? We are waiting for you in our flow experiment.

This story will take you through 2 years of the project life. It all started as a phased Waterfall and transformed into Scrum. Do you want to find out how and why? During this journey you will have a chance to witness confusion, stubbornness, dissatisfaction. It will be topped with a touch of Agile cargo cult. The story will finish with transparency and team happiness, while leaping into beautiful scrum implementation with co-located team and a room full with visualized valuable information for radical transparency.

In this talk, the author will give several use cases from his personal experience helping organizations to implement DevOps initiatives and automation of software delivery and testing.

Why technology X is not what you need right now
Why ignoring skills that are already present in the team may be a huge risk
Why everything-as-code is an effective approach
Why not investing in team member education may be very destructive
Why not having time is a bad excuse for not automating
Why process improvement effects may not be observable immediately
Why cost of automation sometimes is higher than the time invested in writing the scripts"

    about: "The 2019 Scrum Master Trends Report by scrum.org and the State of Agile 2018 shows numbers that provide insight in the maturity of agile adoptions. More than 80% of the companies claim to be in or below a 'still maturing' level. With Scrum being the industry standard (at least in western Europe it is), these numbers are surprising.

In this overview of iterations towards Scrum maturity I describe the characteristics and main challenges to overcome in each maturity stage. This overview might help you as a Scrum Master or leader to assess your current situation and show you a direction in which you might find a solution for the problems you are facing implementing Scrum."

    about: "- Did you came across situations when the same people speak majority of the time?
- Do you find difficult keeping attention at the constant high level throughout the meeting?
- Are you always happy with decision making process and your involvement?

Five conventional structures (practices) guide the way we organize routine interactions and how groups work together: presentations, managed discussions, open discussions, status reports and brainstorm sessions. Liberating Structures add 33 more options to the big five conventional approaches.

During this interactive workshop we will be trying out these new practices and will be learning with fun!

Princess Leia and Chewbacca are coming to Riga! They are coming to liberate us!
People are sitting at their computers and are silent, people are sitting at the meetings and majority are silent too. It looks like we are unlearning to talk, agree and communicate...
Leia brought us a secret weapon - liberating structures. Let's come together in the after lunch session and get armed to teeth! ...and have some fun :)"

    title: "Past, present and future of Agility from an Integral perspective"
    about: "Understanding context is a key factor to set expectations, define appropriate strategies and achieve results in any kind of initiative. The Agile movement started 18 years ago with a simple sentence 'We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it'. Now the Agile movement grew way beyond software offering a new perspective to all kinds of organisations and businesses.
To ensure the success of Agile initiatives, is critical for Agile professionals, enthusiasts and curious people to not only explore Agile but understand the Agility phenomenon itself. As a first step, many questions need to be clearly and consistently answered: What’s the difference between Agile software development and Business Agility? Why does it start in software? Why now? What’s next? Why organisations struggle implementing Agile? How can we make  Agility happen? What does it really mean?

As a result of my more than 13 years of experience helping organisations from more than 30 countries to implement Agile. I’ll give my answer to all this questions from a systemic perspective, based on the Integral theory, in the service of a pragmatic approach to understanding the Agility phenomenon. Furthermore I’ll explain a simple and practical tool for organisational management to design their own strategic planning and goals setting standards and enhance Agility."

    about: "Over the past decade, Evelyn has gained unique and diverse experience coaching organizations large or small, from APAC, to North America, to Europe and to Middle East. She has solid background from product management, project management, people management, software development, system integration, customer support to agile coaching. Her clients range from automotive industry, manufacturing, insurance, banking, e-commerce and of course telecom due to her years of experience in Ericsson.

In this talk, she brings insightful messages for organizations which are in their Agile transformation, wondering how to advance, or are about to start.

Participants will be able to:
- recognize camera-effect transformation and describe alternatives
- list the challenges with squads, and tribes;
- identify possible 'solving a problem now but creating a problem to be solved in the months to come as a consequence'
- explain incorrect understandings and applications of key popular concepts from lean startup, to product discovery, to value flow, to sociocracy, to holacracy.
- restate important factors to consider and fine-tune for Agile transformation

The session is a talk, with short analysis to enforce learning."

    title: "Biology of Powerful Powerless Leader"
    about: "Agile Leadership has its unique flavour of natural leadership, when power is not given with a title but taken by a person based on his/her inner abilities. We use Servant Leadership or Powerless Leader to emphasise this difference. If we look deeper into the biology and neuroscience of leadership we might find really unexpected things – that Agile leaders are the ones that are recognised by nature and we unconsciously can select these people from the crowd. How to become this type of person?
To be an effective Agile leader we need to understand:
What makes a leader: Leader-Leader Agile Model; The difference between a leader and dominant behaviour, why leaders look younger and more active (on hormonal level)
; Hormones and neuroscience of a natural leader (with some cases and practice); Leadership differences and similarities of Scrum Master and Product Owner; Simple (4 words) yet powerful mindset change to become a natural leader that people will follow

        bio: "Anna Obukhova is an Agile Coach working with Agile methodologies since 2004 as a Scrum Master, Agile Coach, Project/Programme Manager and recently as Agile Portfolio Delivery Manager for a large investment bank in London. Anna is mainly interested in distributed and dispersed projects and the effectiveness of team communication in such conditions. Her passion is to collect and share the best industry and company practices in Agile management. She helps Agile teams and programmes to improve their processes and implement the transition from Waterfall to Agile in corporate environments (her clients are major banks and very large companies from other industries).
Additionally, Anna Obukhova is using neuroscience and biology to explain Agile productivity and enhance Agile coaching techniques. My presenting experience started in 2008 and from 2011 internationally.
This perspective of Neuroscience and Agile was agreed to be novel and worth sharing by many conferences, to name a few: ALE Bucharest, Agile Days Moscow, Global Scrum Gathering Paris, Agile Cambridge, Agile Tour London, Agile on the Beach (UK, 2017, 2018), Agile 2017 (Orlando, USA), Agile 2018 (San Diego), Agile Business Conference (Moscow 2017, 2018), Global Scrum Gathering Dublin, Manage Agile (Berlin).
She uses her educations in Biology, Psychology and Coaching to connect working tips and recommendations with the natural processes that happen in our bodies (especially in the brain). She believes it can explain a lot and she`s very excited how naturally Agile works.

    about: "Scrum was officially presented in 1995. In 2001, 17 software development leaders published the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot;. Agile gradually started replacing the industrial way of thinking, with Scrum being the most adopted technique to achieve a higher state of agility. Today, 2018, the Agile paradigm is more needed than ever, to avoid complexity turning into perplexity. Gunther aspires disentangling the clew that ’Scrum’ and ‘Agile’ turned into and show the value and their originality. Gunther has considered what Agile means to him, what it is that makes Agile work, what it is that makes Scrum work, and will share his views on the future state of Scrum and Agile."

Insights on how to organise work of a distributed team, how to share codebase between different teams, how to onboard new developers efficiently, what are preconditions for scaling, what could make a scaling attempt to fail and etc.

Can you have two agile teams instead of one in a short period of time? Can some company with two offices work as smoothly as a company, where all employees are sitting in the same building? Can you have the same values in different teams?
My answer is &quot;yes&quot;, but everything comes with a price. This session tells about what price you have to pay in order to scale your software development business.
Also it is going to explore which aspects of corporate culture can prevent or can support scaling process, what kind scaling aspects require more attention than others, how to setup a distributed teams in distributed company.

Once, consulting a 3-months old company of my friend, I got it clear. Although those problems of big and small enterprises are very different, the roots of that problems are quite the same. The same patterns keeps from org to org, and these patterns constitute the most hard impediments on the way to agility.

  In my speech I’m going to share the insights on the nature of this patterns, show how they work, and give ideas on what could be done to move away from the dead point."

    title: "Reframe your existing Agile change plans to be implemented everywhere in the company"
    about: "The Agile manifesto helps uncover better ways to develop software. How can you expand a change plan from the small I.T. teams to the rest of the company?
Many of the new practices or techniques used inside I.T. teams don’t work well or need to be adapted when they are implemented somewhere else in the organization—outside the I.T. world.
A real change plan transforms the whole company and not just the software teams. Otherwise, it would be improving the local groups but downgrading the rest of the organization.
Which consistent patterns can you use to create powerful plans that can be implemented everywhere?

The answer requires to use different strategies that go beyond Agile and Scrum.
This session provides an insight into how to adapt any change initiative to be easily implemented in the rest of the organization. It also shows the ways to make sure that a business transformation doesn’t lose traction.
Join this session from the author of the best-seller book &quote;Leading Exponential Change&quote;."

From my speech you will learn the traits of strong tribes and the journey any group has to make to become a real tribe. We will be looking at the tribes you belong to and how can you help them become stronger and healthier."

    about: "Rules how to do business in 400k people company are very different from what people are used to in small and mid-size companies. It's similar to running your own company but few things are very different. I'll tell more about environment I live in, what targets we have as team and why we are being so successful.

  Last year at world class conference &quot;All Day DevOps&quot; I told about my journey how we grew from 0 to 100. Guess what - it didn't solve all our issues. This year I'm happy to continue my story with new things we implemented to build foundation for further growth.

  This can be treated as &quot;management talk&quot; but DevOps is never just about tools. This talk covers cultural and business side which are very important to be the best in DevOps and IT world in general."

Are there specific practices to follow or processes to impose that nurture a truly agile team? Do agile values and principles come naturally to people who possess a certain mindset? Does company culture affect the personal qualities and values ​​of its employees?
I believe that it is possible to  acquire an agile philosophy without following a standard set of rules. Based on our experience, I will try to prove that it’s not the practices and processes that make the team truly agile, but the mindset of people who work there. I will also describe the special qualities that our people, teams, and the company as a whole exemplify, and how these talents can be cultivated and nurtured."

    title: "Avoid Agile transformations"
    about: "Agile is no longer a set of software development methods used by a bunch of innovators. Nowadays Agile is arguably the most popular and successful product development strategy. Therefore many organisations decided to start their &quot;Agile transformation&quot; to become a different organisation that is able to operate in a new business paradigm….. Or not?
Is it possible to transform an organisation? Is it viable to influence the culture, structure and processes in an organization to successfully operate as an entirely different entity? Is a transformation needed to succed in business?
I will use Complexity thinking and Cynefin in practice to answer this questions from a experimental perspective. By making sense of the different business contexts, and understanding what are the more suitable practices for each context you will be able to understand when Agility makes sense and how to make business Agility happen.
In this talk I’ll share my thoughts about Agile transformations: why this is becoming important in this moment of history, why Agile emerges in the software industry, how is agile connected to the 21st century customer, how Agile addresses the need of continuous innovation and why the concept of &quot;Agile Transformation&quot; can be an stopper for organisations to achieve a real growth.

Learning Outcomes:
Understand Business Agility,
Describe why Agile is not always the answer,
Understand why &quot;Agile transformations&quot; are often failing,
Explain why the concept &quot;Agile transformation&quot; should be substituted by &quot;Incorporating experimentation capabilities&quot;,
Define an Strategy for business Agility based on complexity thinking,
Understanding of the core of agile,
contextualize Agile in the current world of business.
Powerful and proven arguments to encourage business people to get involved in Agile initiatives."

    about: "In this talk I will try to shed some light on the history of Agile. I was talking to Manifesto signatories reconstructing the talks they had about the deeper meaning of Agile and looking around 17 years later, I can say that we have lost the real meaning of this word.

  I want to share with you my findings about the What and about the How of Agile. We will be discussing three goals of Agility and talking about the reasons why different companies are starting on this path. I will tell you about a few wrong reasons and a couple of good ones.

  I will also answer the question many people are asking now: is Agile dead?, should we switch to building Real organisations instead?"

    title: "Learning Through Osmosis"
    about: "Many different roles contribute to building software: product owners, business specialists. testers. Yet knowledge of programming keeps these roles at a distance. In this talk, I will share how I have come to programming: not through wanting to program and taking courses on it, but through working with programmers in a style called mob programming. This talk serves as an inspiration for programmers to invite non-programmers to learning code a layer at a time, immersed in the experience of creating software together to transform the ability to deliver. Lessons specific to skillsets rub in both ways, leaving everyone better off after the experience. In this talk, you will learn: What is mob programming and why you should care about working in that style? How to use strong-style pairing as a means of connecting everyone regardless of their programming skill level? What contributions non-programmers make in a mob before they learn to program? How I became a programmer through working in mobs at work and at community meetups over learning by studying programming?"

    title: "Leadership, Complexity, LeSS"
    about: "This session focuses on common root causes that create unintended and unseen complexity in organizations. This complexity is disguised in the form of good management practices, and good intentions and local optimizations. We use one case to describe the rise of complexity and the death of a company Nokia Mobile Phones. Then we show that this pattern can be generalized to any growing company that does not pay attention how to grow. Next, we take a look at Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework and how it avoids building complexity in an organization by being minimalistic and starting the change by real change instead of change theater. Then we look at forces in LeSS that create ownership of change in the organization. We use real life case examples to describe how this is achieved and what key leadership actions are needed to happen, so the change is sustainable. Learning objectives: Insight how LeSS and new leadership thinking is used to simplify the organization."

The focus will be on 3 habits: MissDoesALot, MissKnowsALot, MissFearsALot. I will list the negative downsides, how to identify and some steps to take to improve from there. My personal conclusion is that I was not as helpful to my teams as I have hoped. It’s amazing how sometimes one gets blinded by the good intentions that also contributes to growth of own ignorance and blindness. Luckily it is not all that grim and I have a list of 10 golden rules I’d love to share. These lessons were learned while volunteering at different conventions and conferences. Cheers!"

    title: "How Scrum Can Help Me to Save Money on the Long Term?"
    about: "It was almost midnight when I heard my phone ringing. For my clients from the other part of the Globe it was middle of the day. And not a particular good one. Nothing was working for them because of a bug. What bug? Well, a bug which appeared when they tried to use the application with their new file format. Apparently this blocked their entire system. Damn (!!!) (sigh), not much to do at this hour, I thought, let’s wait for the morning to come to have the chance to talk with the development team, hoping that we will still meet our SLAs. Morning came and I called the technical guys. What ?? Only Alex can solve the problem and he is on holiday?? And he is coming back in two weeks??… As you can imagine, there was no happy end. And the company had to pay a lot of money for not respecting our SLAs. Does the story above sound familiar to you? Unfortunately, I am sure that many of you know what I am talking about. In this presentation we will discuss how to measure the cost of owning a software application and how to decrease this cost as much as possible. For measuring how much a software application costs, instead of considering only the purchase price of an object, the complete cost from purchase to disposal have to be summed up. This calculation is called Total Cost of Ownership, abbreviated TCO, and is designed to help in financial decisions by giving a picture of the profitability over time."

    about: "'In order to make delicious food,you must eat delicious food…. you need to develop a palate capable of discerning good and bad. Without good taste, you can't make good food.' - Jiro Ono (World’s Best Sushi Chef). The same is true for great code. If we want to make great code we need a refined palate for what great code looks like. We need to look at code and develop a sense for it’s properties and smells. Sadly this is rarely ever done. Programmers are expected to just 'know' what is good and what is bad with ever getting a chance to develop and curate an aesthetic sense. Worse, code is rarely looked at unless it is causing us problems so we are expected to be gourmets while spending our time eating at McDonalds. Come work on your sense of code. We will look at many snippets to compare and contrast different aspects of what good code is. Learning Outcomes: How to identify and correct, Clutter, Long lines, Long Methods, Bad Names, Duplication, Inconsistency."

    title: "Remote Team Facilitation and Scaled Scrum: How to Make It Work!"
    about: "Near-, and off-shoring introduces complexity in scrum teams. When we scale scrum, this complexity is amplified and drastically reduces meeting efficiency. Is there a silver bullet to make remote teams high-performant in a (scaled) scrum environment? When facilitating agile workshops, you probably experienced the difficulties of keeping the remote participants involved. And maybe you also know how hard it is to facilitate a highly interactive session with more than 50 people? Or how much harder it gets when 10 of them are connected remotely? I learned time after time participants feel left out, not listened to or find it impossible to follow discussions. Your sessions, intended to boost productivity, demotivate your remote teams. Join this talk if you are a facilitator working with one or more near-shore teams. I will share my day-to-day experiences and insights that will help you to involve your remote teams."

    title: "Agile Organization - Organization 3.0"
    about: "The rules of work are changing. Organization 3.0 reflects Agility, an understanding of tribal leadership models, and a recognition that new rules are needed to navigate new organizations that are changing the world today. Teamwork, collaboration, and positive relationships are what matter. If you cannot adopt the new standards, you will be left behind. Previous organizational structures and processes also reflected their times. Organization 1.0, showed the mentality of industrialism, with stable hierarchies and rule following the norm. Organization 2.0 rewarded specialization, processes, and structure over teams and groups. The 'me first' workplace served the lucky few, but is now being replaced by a new generation, with a more thoughtful organization of our lives and work."

    about: "Since invented in 2009 lego4scrum has become a very popular simulation to teach Scrum. Nowadays how to get several teams to scrum, seems, is no longer a secret. Though knowing how to make agile work in a large-scale multi-team environment is. So In 2016 I was able to scale lego4scrum to over 155 people (22 development teams) all building an overall product. This approach is described in a newly released book called (what a suprise!): 'lego4scrum'. This practical session we will simulated a large-scale environment with 10+ teams (we need your help - please come to this session!). What will we be doing: working closely with the market representatives to know their needs, achieving shared understanding of a product with 10+ teams working together, setting up a suitable (flat) organizational structure capable of delivering, putting a lightweight process on top that is barely enough but enables self-management, building a working product that satisfies the market needs. Great helpers here are understanding complexity and system thinking, knowing how Scrum really works on the team-level, and few core ideas from LeSS framework, such as: an overall product backlog, a single Product Owner, joint team meetings."

    title: "A Coding Dojo With a Twist"
    about: "A CyberDojo is coding dojo with a difference. Each group: writes their code and tests inside a web browser; presses their run-tests button to submit their code and tests to the CyberDojo server, the server saves the submission, runs the tests, and returns the test-outcome to the browser as a traffic light; green if all the tests passed; amber if the tests could not be run (eg syntax error); red if one or more tests failed; a dashboard shows each groups traffic light history. Click on any traffic light to open a diff-view of that submission; periodically a bell rings, indicating the driver from each group must move to another group and become a navigator. I built CyberDojo to promote deliberate software practice of: test driven development, and team dynamics and collaboration. I strongly believe that if you practice coding using your normal development environment then you are likely to be drawn into an unhelpful “completion” mindset. Practising in a CyberDojo helps to combat this tendency since a CyberDojo is so obviously not your normal development environment! Practising in a CyberDojo helps you to concentrate on the practice."

    title: "Agile Communication"
    about: "Everybody agrees these days that communication is one of the key success factors in any project, regardless of their size and complexity. During the agile adoption process, many teams and managers are blind to communication issues and believe everything is working just fine. However, experience suggests that communication is failing at many levels -managers don't really understand their developers, testers and other geeks, who on the other hand often fail to effectively sell their point back to management. Similar situations exist between sales and technical experts or even between developers and testers.
            The fact is that speaking the same language doesn't guarantee the understanding of each other's points. This highly-interactive talk shows typical communication patterns, behaviors and provides eye-opening insights into the ways communication can improved Some practical games include the whole audience, which typically makes the session very lively and engaging."

    title: "Agile Contracts — Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis"
    about: "Thesis: In order to have control over software project, a customer needs to have a contract that holds a supplier’s feet to the fire and fixes the price and scope of what is delivered. Antithesis: Effective projects require collaboration between a customer and a supplier. A contract that fixes the price and scope of the project undermines the trust needed for this collaboration. Synthesis: Target price contract aligns the incentives of the supplier and the customer towards making the scope match the budget. This gives the customer control over the price and value of the created software while maintaining a collaborative environment."

    title: "Anonymous Analyst"
    about: "The role of software analyst is full of misunderstandings. In cross-functional teams we focus on having a shared vision and shared architecture. We avoid specializations, we force every member of a team to act and pull required information from all available sources without additional chains in the communication. The role of traditional software analyst does not fit nicely into Scrum either. They have been usually separated from teams and we cannot call them neither Scrum Masters nor Product Owners. However, software analysts play essential role in cross-functional teams. Our understanding of what they should do and the role they play in a team should be different. Analysts help us understand and we should focus on sharing this understanding inside the team. Here I will present the roots of misunderstandings and some practical tips how they can be avoided."

    title: "Becoming Agile in Public Sector Project"
    about: "Becoming agile is not an easy task, especially if you are working in public sector project. Though it is possible and we have managed to do it. Here is our advice on how to do it: Seek for opportunities. Public sector project carry pretty heavy burden of administrative work, which does not go well together with strive of agile practices to eliminate waste. Though sometimes things which seem to us as obstacles at the first glance, are in fact opportunities. We will teach you how to use some of them; Start small. Starting all is often scary, and build resistance to agile practices on both customer and supplier side. By implementing practice by practice you will have enough time to gain trust and build confidence of the team; Work harder! When you start using agile practices in software development, all team members both on customer and supplier side have to commit to following them. Lack of commitment justified by lack of understanding or complexity of chosen approach might actually hide bigger problem - insufficient ability to deliver. Sometimes it is enough just to start working."

    about: "How do I make my managers more Agile? How can I convince developers to educate themselves? How can I make customers more cooperative? How do I start a European network of Agile and Lean practitioners? When transforming organizations and other social systems people usually encounter obstacles. And these obstacles very often involve changing other people’s behaviors. Of course, we cannot really _make_ people behave in a different way. We also cannot really make people laugh, and we cannot really make people happy. But… we can certainly try! This session is about Change Management 3.0. It is a new change management “super model” which views organizations as complex adaptive systems and social networks. The Change Management 3.0 supermodel wraps various existing models (PDCA, ADKAR, Adoption Curve and The 5 I's). It lists a few dozen hard questions that can help people in their attempts to change the behaviors of other people in an organization and beyond. No matter whether you are a manager, Scrum Master, Product Owner, software developer or writer, anyone will find it useful to know how to change the world around them."

    about: "Managers are often quoted as an impediment for Agile adoption. We have seen also otherwise: managers might be the crucial make it or break it force within organization that is ongoing change. In this presentation several aspects  of change management, leadership and coaching are touched. Real-life examples from Ericsson Finland: team formation and operation (managers and coaches role), Change Roadmap, coaching Leadership Teams, different levels of coaching (individuals, teams, PO, portfolio, line management on different levels). What is required from a management coach? How to get involvement? Why Scrum was seen as a threat for managers? How to involve people to change managers?"

    about: "A code base must be changed, or it will die. But sometimes these changes feels like a fight with the Legacy Software Hydra, for every scary head cut off, two more grows out. Every change takes us further from the goal! Instead, come learn the Mikado Method, a systematic approach to beat the Hydra and change the code in a safe way. It enables continuous delivery, and it enhances team communication, collaboration and learning, helping individuals stay on track. We will practice to visualize, prepare and perform business-value-focused changes, without having a broken code-base in the process. Process/Mechanics: Participants sharing code change horror stories to get in the mood; The horror story behind the Mikado Method, and the resolution; The core concepts to make it work, and the benefits of it; The Mikado Method kata in Java code (https://github.com/mikadomethod/kata-java), performed by presenter; Q&A/Debriefing. Participants perform same demo as a kata. Bring Your Own Laptop!! (Java and C# examples provided); Q&A/Debriefing.

Fueled by many new thoughts he began his Agile journey which later led him to start a company specializing in XP and Scrum. In 2005 Ola started Agical with three colleagues, one of Sweden’s most prominent Agile coaching companies of today. As an expert in software developing skills such as TDD and Continuous Integration as well as more soft skills he coaches both developers and leaders while they are learning Agile practices and methods. Today he is working with clients that are working with or would like to be working with Agile methods. This often puts him in situations where he has to defend, promote and question the values and practices behind Agile which he has become very familiar with. Ola is also one of the driving forces behind ‘Agile Sweden’, Sweden’s biggest Agile network."

    about: "Early in 2010 we implemented Scrum in Adform as its development process. More than 40 people were split to 6 cross functional teams. So what’s the big deal you will ask? The big deal for us was: we all work developing ONE product (SaS Ads Serving platform)! We are not working on separate projects! How to organize Product Management work to fit this? How 6 Product Owners should work together, with company management, and other departments? How to split big features and divide work to teams (usually one feature had to be implemented by few teams to bring value to the customer)? What to do with 'research' projects? How to handle the growth of the company (now we have more than 50 people and 8 teams)? In this presentation I will share our journey, as well as mistakes we made and lessons learned. If you are implementing Agile in organization or project with many teams working on one product - this presentation is for you."

Are they effective in getting us to do better work? The world famous consultant Dr W Edwards Deming, who was “the man who taught the Japanese, America and many other countries about quality”, created The Red Bead Experiment in 1982 to communicate his take on the subject. In this session we will run a version of the experiment that has been slightly adapted for software development by David P. Joyce. The experiment introduces many of Deming’s ideas about management, the principles of variation and statistical process control charts. And it is a humorous and fun experience for both participants and audience! After the experiment there will be a presentation followed by a group discussions on the learning points and how they can be related to software development and the management of software development teams."

But increasingly, we're losing touch with the very thing that allows us to be successful. We're forgetting about how to make our (development) clients happy. More fundamentally, this means that we're losing touch with the end goal: to build products that have a high value, regardless of how they're developed. In this session i'll show you modern agile methodology called BDD and couple of accompanied tools, that will finally help you on the way to make well thought products."

    about: "Improvement initiatives are like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it. For decades most of improvement programs fail. Interestingly enough, with the rise of Agile and Lean the success rates of change initiatives don’t get better. Why so? Every now and then we focus on processes and methods. We exploit success stories from other organizations just to find ourselves failing again. Should it be a surprise given how little attention we pay to our specific context? Should it be a surprise given bias toward methods and tools at cost of mindset? Let me discuss some of methods we use to drive improvements. My goal is to show you that most of the time you shouldn’t even bother to use them. The missing bit is almost never a tool or a method. This is going to be sort of myth busting. We need that to change our focus to the important bits: right mindset and understanding the context."

    about: "This presentation will look into a Scrum Master role as proposed by the Scrum framework. At first - role's essentials in Scrum and shortly its similarities with identical roles in other methods, then overview of this role's different interpretations across the industry and my own experience in that. Why this topic? Scrum Master is a central role in an environment that wants to become Agile. While in the first place Scrum Master is serving a team, he or she is also serving an organization. Scrum Master is a soft role more than a hard one (like developer) and therefore includes coaching too. In my experience and research, above aspects are often under-estimated, which have significant impact on the overall work productivity of an organization that adopts or has adopted Agile. I would like to try clearing things out around this role together with you in ADR 2015!"

It allows us to see what do we do ourselves in a different perspective. Agile approach has a lot in common with far more mature scientific development. Let's look at what scientists do? Observe a process, get an idea and check it. What is next? Observe, renew the idea and check it again. What is next? Observe, renew the idea and check it again. What is next? Observe and try do figure out something essential of the process. Usually it is called a hypothesis and an experiment and the development tends to be their sequence."

    about: "Software architecture is a vital part of the project development life cycle. Done explicitly by a software architect or implicitly in the head of a developer, it has an important role in the whole process. Changes in the requirements, vague definitions, and poor documentation, however, are some of the usual problems software architects encounter. On the other hand Agile methodology gives us ideas how to deal with these problems. Iterations, meetings, and early evaluations are some of the proposed techniques. Can one apply Agile in the context of software architecture? How can a software architect react on specification changes? How can we keep up-to-date documentation of our system? In this talk I will try to give answers to these questions based on my experience and I will do a short demo to illustrate a real scenario."

    title: "Being Agile to Become Customer Centric"
    about: "The first principle of Agile manifesto says 'Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.' But, Is our highest priority to delight our customer, or to delight our sponsor. Do we understand who the real customer is and behave accordingly? I’ve often seen Agile teams producing software aimed to delight: another departments within their organization, an external organization hiring their development services, their management or even their Product Owners. But, are those the ones to be delighted by the product in development? I believe that software is awesome when it helps creating awesome experiences to the people the organization is serving. To create those delighting experiences is very important to understand who your real customer is and empathize with him. This session is aimed to create that awareness and to introduce some practical tools that can help creating a 'Customer Centric' Agile implementation and culture in organizations. I will start the session by explaining what is customer centricity and how it can become the competitive advantage of your business and a powerful reason for adopting Agile. I'll continue with simple tips, and practical examples, which attendees can incorporate into your Agile implementation to empower customer delighting. Such as including “moments of truth” in “Personas” and going from 'User Stories' to 'Customer Stories' The listener will get from this session easy-to-apply tools to equip their Agile implementation an extra focus on their real customer to maximize customer satisfaction and create an important foundation for the buy-in of Agile by the business."

    title: "No Estimates: Let's Explore the Possibilities"
    about: "'The only sure thing about forecasts is that they are WRONG' - James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones. Estimates have been the bane of software development and programmers for decades. Managers/Customers want to know: When will it be done? How much will it cost? Programmers are told 'We won't hold you to the estimate', and yet they often are. It's my contention that estimates are not useful for this purpose, and even worse they misinform the decisions they are meant to support. Do we really need estimates? Is simply 'getting better' at estimates worthwhile? Can we live without them? Will things be better without them? I don't have answers for you, but I've worked with 'no estimates' for over 4 years and I'm still alive. I want to explore the idea of estimates, why they are pervasive in the programming world, how they might be harmful, and see if we can start a dialog about finding a better way to make decisions."

    title: "Performance Reviews Are Incompatible with the Agile MindSet"
    about: "Have you had blood pressure and heart beat increase with the proximity of the annual performance review rituals? Do you get the chills just before your 'performance improvement plan' meeting with your boss? Have you had a poor review because you were not able to perform how you boss wanted, but in reality you could not have done anything different? Performance Reviews are based in completely wrong assumptions. Companies still think that Performance Reviews are great tools to provide feedback, to set goals and to improve the individuals. All this is pure nonsense and in reality Performance Reviews are a cancer for our companies and they need to be removed. Come to see my talk and you will understand how Performance Reviews are completely incompatible with Agile Mindset and I will explain what can be done using examples of companies from all over the world that successfully tackled this problem."

    about: "Let's focus on practical case analysis and avoid general statements you can hear on any agile conference. I will become a storyteller and will share a set of stories, representing lessons learned from runnung an agile project in a waterfall-based telecom culture. I will also give a clear understanding what was a project setup. What was done differently from the enterprise waterfall-based project management standard? What agile principles and specific practices were applied? What were tangible benefits to the business from the situation where one project team became 'outlaws' of the corporate culture. Moreover, I will share the challenges and lessons learned related to both phases - the transfer project and further operations and development of the Service Desk function."

I love exploring cross-cultural differences and travel, so I do that in a form of 'workations' – public speaking on conferences + site seeing.

    about: "Agile is not new. Agile is not a trend. Agile is established. Yet we struggle with a lot of problems doing Agile. Arie's diagnose regarding this problem is most of the time connected to what Arie calls 'Agile in the Core'. Arie has found over the last 20 years that the success of Agile is connected to the quality and discipline used applying the Agile techniques. These techniques are based in strong foundations. During his key note Arie will talk about the true the core of Agile, what it means, how you do them and how you can coach your client doing it. Learn more about Agile in the Core, application and how take your client with you in either continuous delivery or projects."

        bio: "Co-author of the Agile Manifesto. Thoughtleader at Wemanity Group. Agile is what you are by nature. Then you can really make it work. It is a paradigm shift when you are used to traditional ways of working. It is a mind set to really be and work Agile. If you are not used to it you can learn this. If you like to know more check www.wemanity.com, www.agileconsortium.net, #arievanbennekum and the information about Wemanity in the media and on the web. In 1994 I made my change. Coming from a very traditional environment as developer and technical designer I switched to RAD and later DSDM. I got involved in communities started publishing, training and coaching. Later I got on the board of the DSDM Consortium Benelux and I represented DSDM when we wrote the Agile Manifesto (www.agilemanifesto.org) in February 2001. Now I am working as thought leader for Wemanity. Many years ago I identified that it is in the people that makes the difference over and over again when people struggle to make Agile successful. Agile is in its essence an interaction concept. Basic participation and interaction techniques make Agie work, additional tools can make it excel but the fundament is in the interaction. In our transformation we focus in this, in both small and very large environments. Want to know more? Let me know...
