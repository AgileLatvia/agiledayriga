    title: "Learning Through Osmosis"
    about: "Many different roles contribute to building software: product owners, business specialists. testers. Yet knowledge of programming keeps these roles at a distance. In this talk, I will share how I have come to programming: not through wanting to program and taking courses on it, but through working with programmers in a style called mob programming. This talk serves as an inspiration for programmers to invite non-programmers to learning code a layer at a time, immersed in the experience of creating software together to transform the ability to deliver. Lessons specific to skillsets rub in both ways, leaving everyone better off after the experience. In this talk, you will learn: What is mob programming and why you should care about working in that style? How to use strong-style pairing as a means of connecting everyone regardless of their programming skill level? What contributions non-programmers make in a mob before they learn to program? How I became a programmer through working in mobs at work and at community meetups over learning by studying programming?"

    title: "Leadership, Complexity, LeSS"
    about: "This session focuses on common root causes that create unintended and unseen complexity in organizations. This complexity is disguised in the form of good management practices, and good intentions and local optimizations. We use one case to describe the rise of complexity and the death of a company Nokia Mobile Phones. Then we show that this pattern can be generalized to any growing company that does not pay attention how to grow. Next, we take a look at Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework and how it avoids building complexity in an organization by being minimalistic and starting the change by real change instead of change theater. Then we look at forces in LeSS that create ownership of change in the organization. We use real life case examples to describe how this is achieved and what key leadership actions are needed to happen, so the change is sustainable. Learning objectives: Insight how LeSS and new leadership thinking is used to simplify the organization."

    about: "When people talk about Scrum they usually discuss corresponding roles, artifacts and events. Also most of the people think that Scrum is about fast delivery. Well, actually Scrum is about radical organizational changes and optimizing business value. Proper Scrum implementation leads to changes in organizational structures, policies and processes. Also proper Scrum implementation means descaling your organization and making it a much flatter one. Not obvious why? Let’s discuss it."

    about: "Over the course of past years I have gotten into trouble with my co-workers and I would like to share this with others in hope that perhaps some of these you have not yet made. The focus will be on 3 habits: MissDoesALot, MissKnowsALot, MissFearsALot. I will list the negative downsides, how to identify and some steps to take to improve from there. My personal conclusion is that I was not as helpful to my teams as I have hoped. It’s amazing how sometimes one gets blinded by the good intentions that also contributes to growth of own ignorance and blindness. Luckily it is not all that grim and I have a list of 10 golden rules I’d love to share. These lessons were learned while volunteering at different conventions and conferences. Cheers!"

    title: "How Scrum Can Help Me to Save Money on the Long Term?"
    about: "It was almost midnight when I heard my phone ringing. For my clients from the other part of the Globe it was middle of the day. And not a particular good one. Nothing was working for them because of a bug. What bug? Well, a bug which appeared when they tried to use the application with their new file format. Apparently this blocked their entire system. Damn (!!!) (sigh), not much to do at this hour, I thought, let’s wait for the morning to come to have the chance to talk with the development team, hoping that we will still meet our SLAs. Morning came and I called the technical guys. What ?? Only Alex can solve the problem and he is on holiday?? And he is coming back in two weeks??… As you can imagine, there was no happy end. And the company had to pay a lot of money for not respecting our SLAs. Does the story above sound familiar to you? Unfortunately, I am sure that many of you know what I am talking about. In this presentation we will discuss how to measure the cost of owning a software application and how to decrease this cost as much as possible. For measuring how much a software application costs, instead of considering only the purchase price of an object, the complete cost from purchase to disposal have to be summed up. This calculation is called Total Cost of Ownership, abbreviated TCO, and is designed to help in financial decisions by giving a picture of the profitability over time."

When I try to address it, techy geeks get into techy rumble and forget what was the question about. This talk abstracts from technology and focuses purely on cultural and organizational topics in a fun way. 'So… meet delivery lead John. He got a brilliant idea - how basically from nothing to make the cutest bunny in the world.'"

    about: "Being agile is all about embracing change. Therefore, the notion of agility should apply to the process itself. If it is not changing over time, chances are, you are not being agile. In today’s dynamic business environment, we should be careful with “one-size-fits-all” frameworks and rather tailor the process to people and context. In this talk, we will focus on the mind-set, principles and values required to become Agnostic Agile."

    about: "'In order to make delicious food,you must eat delicious food…. you need to develop a palate capable of discerning good and bad. Without good taste, you can't make good food.' - Jiro Ono (World’s Best Sushi Chef). The same is true for great code. If we want to make great code we need a refined palate for what great code looks like. We need to look at code and develop a sense for it’s properties and smells. Sadly this is rarely ever done. Programmers are expected to just 'know' what is good and what is bad with ever getting a chance to develop and curate an aesthetic sense. Worse, code is rarely looked at unless it is causing us problems so we are expected to be gourmets while spending our time eating at McDonalds. Come work on your sense of code. We will look at many snippets to compare and contrast different aspects of what good code is. Learning Outcomes: How to identify and correct, Clutter, Long lines, Long Methods, Bad Names, Duplication, Inconsistency."

    title: "Remote Team Facilitation and Scaled Scrum: How to Make It Work!"
    about: "Near-, and off-shoring introduces complexity in scrum teams. When we scale scrum, this complexity is amplified and drastically reduces meeting efficiency. Is there a silver bullet to make remote teams high-performant in a (scaled) scrum environment? When facilitating agile workshops, you probably experienced the difficulties of keeping the remote participants involved. And maybe you also know how hard it is to facilitate a highly interactive session with more than 50 people? Or how much harder it gets when 10 of them are connected remotely? I learned time after time participants feel left out, not listened to or find it impossible to follow discussions. Your sessions, intended to boost productivity, demotivate your remote teams. Join this talk if you are a facilitator working with one or more near-shore teams. I will share my day-to-day experiences and insights that will help you to involve your remote teams."

    about: "The rules of work are changing. Organization 3.0 reflects Agility, an understanding of tribal leadership models, and a recognition that new rules are needed to navigate new organizations that are changing the world today. Teamwork, collaboration, and positive relationships are what matter. If you cannot adopt the new standards, you will be left behind. Previous organizational structures and processes also reflected their times. Organization 1.0, showed the mentality of industrialism, with stable hierarchies and rule following the norm. Organization 2.0 rewarded specialization, processes, and structure over teams and groups. The 'me first' workplace served the lucky few, but is now being replaced by a new generation, with a more thoughtful organization of our lives and work."

    title: "Workshop: Large-Scale Scrum simulation with LEGO!"
    about: "Since invented in 2009 lego4scrum has become a very popular simulation to teach Scrum. Nowadays how to get several teams to scrum, seems, is no longer a secret. Though knowing how to make agile work in a large-scale multi-team environment is. So In 2016 I was able to scale lego4scrum to over 155 people (22 development teams) all building an overall product. This approach is described in a newly released book called (what a suprise!): 'lego4scrum'. This practical session we will simulated a large-scale environment with 10+ teams (we need your help - please come to this session!). What will we be doing: working closely with the market representatives to know their needs, achieving shared understanding of a product with 10+ teams working together, setting up a suitable (flat) organizational structure capable of delivering, putting a lightweight process on top that is barely enough but enables self-management, building a working product that satisfies the market needs. Great helpers here are understanding complexity and system thinking, knowing how Scrum really works on the team-level, and few core ideas from LeSS framework, such as: an overall product backlog, a single Product Owner, joint team meetings."

        bio: "Vladimirs Ivanovs (40), have realised that I am the 'fox' and as philosopher Isaiah Berlin puts it 'the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing'. Since then I’ve started to form teams with the 'hedgehog focus'. agiletransofrmer.com is a perfect hedgehog, as is formed by the practitioners for the practitioners around one big thing – Agile (closely connected to Lean and Kanban). I love exploring cross-cultural differences and travel, so I do that in a form of 'workations' – public speaking on conferences + site seeing. Events are not only Agile related (also IPMA, PMI, itSMF, IT) in the following countries: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, India."

    about: "In order to do successful development, you want metrics to tell you whether you are heading to the right direction. In this talk you will get an example of measurement stack aligned through strategy, customer, current operational mode - all the way to changes that you are introducing. From the session you will get example tools for measuring: Change in business environment, Customer understanding, Process cycle efficiency, Change implementation progress, Continuous improvement and learning. One key thing is also to keep the metrics lean. So sweep away the massive Excel sheets and bring in simple indicators that everyone can understand, from developers to decision-makers."

    title: "A Coding Dojo With a Twist"
    about: "A CyberDojo is coding dojo with a difference. Each group: writes their code and tests inside a web browser; presses their run-tests button to submit their code and tests to the CyberDojo server, the server saves the submission, runs the tests, and returns the test-outcome to the browser as a traffic light; green if all the tests passed; amber if the tests could not be run (eg syntax error); red if one or more tests failed; a dashboard shows each groups traffic light history. Click on any traffic light to open a diff-view of that submission; periodically a bell rings, indicating the driver from each group must move to another group and become a navigator. I built CyberDojo to promote deliberate software practice of: test driven development, and team dynamics and collaboration. I strongly believe that if you practice coding using your normal development environment then you are likely to be drawn into an unhelpful “completion” mindset. Practising in a CyberDojo helps to combat this tendency since a CyberDojo is so obviously not your normal development environment! Practising in a CyberDojo helps you to concentrate on the practice."

    title: "Agile Communication"
    about: "Everybody agrees these days that communication is one of the key success factors in any project, regardless of their size and complexity. During the agile adoption process, many teams and managers are blind to communication issues and believe everything is working just fine. However, experience suggests that communication is failing at many levels -managers don't really understand their developers, testers and other geeks, who on the other hand often fail to effectively sell their point back to management. Similar situations exist between sales and technical experts or even between developers and testers.
            The fact is that speaking the same language doesn't guarantee the understanding of each other's points. This highly-interactive talk shows typical communication patterns, behaviors and provides eye-opening insights into the ways communication can improved Some practical games include the whole audience, which typically makes the session very lively and engaging."

    about: "Thesis: In order to have control over software project, a customer needs to have a contract that holds a supplier’s feet to the fire and fixes the price and scope of what is delivered. Antithesis: Effective projects require collaboration between a customer and a supplier. A contract that fixes the price and scope of the project undermines the trust needed for this collaboration. Synthesis: Target price contract aligns the incentives of the supplier and the customer towards making the scope match the budget. This gives the customer control over the price and value of the created software while maintaining a collaborative environment."

    about: "The role of software analyst is full of misunderstandings. In cross-functional teams we focus on having a shared vision and shared architecture. We avoid specializations, we force every member of a team to act and pull required information from all available sources without additional chains in the communication. The role of traditional software analyst does not fit nicely into Scrum either. They have been usually separated from teams and we cannot call them neither Scrum Masters nor Product Owners. However, software analysts play essential role in cross-functional teams. Our understanding of what they should do and the role they play in a team should be different. Analysts help us understand and we should focus on sharing this understanding inside the team. Here I will present the roots of misunderstandings and some practical tips how they can be avoided."

    title: "Becoming Agile in Public Sector Project"
    about: "Becoming agile is not an easy task, especially if you are working in public sector project. Though it is possible and we have managed to do it. Here is our advice on how to do it: Seek for opportunities. Public sector project carry pretty heavy burden of administrative work, which does not go well together with strive of agile practices to eliminate waste. Though sometimes things which seem to us as obstacles at the first glance, are in fact opportunities. We will teach you how to use some of them; Start small. Starting all is often scary, and build resistance to agile practices on both customer and supplier side. By implementing practice by practice you will have enough time to gain trust and build confidence of the team; Work harder! When you start using agile practices in software development, all team members both on customer and supplier side have to commit to following them. Lack of commitment justified by lack of understanding or complexity of chosen approach might actually hide bigger problem - insufficient ability to deliver. Sometimes it is enough just to start working."

    title: "How to Change the World"
    about: "How do I make my managers more Agile? How can I convince developers to educate themselves? How can I make customers more cooperative? How do I start a European network of Agile and Lean practitioners? When transforming organizations and other social systems people usually encounter obstacles. And these obstacles very often involve changing other people’s behaviors. Of course, we cannot really _make_ people behave in a different way. We also cannot really make people laugh, and we cannot really make people happy. But… we can certainly try! This session is about Change Management 3.0. It is a new change management “super model” which views organizations as complex adaptive systems and social networks. The Change Management 3.0 supermodel wraps various existing models (PDCA, ADKAR, Adoption Curve and The 5 I's). It lists a few dozen hard questions that can help people in their attempts to change the behaviors of other people in an organization and beyond. No matter whether you are a manager, Scrum Master, Product Owner, software developer or writer, anyone will find it useful to know how to change the world around them."

    about: "Managers are often quoted as an impediment for Agile adoption. We have seen also otherwise: managers might be the crucial make it or break it force within organization that is ongoing change. In this presentation several aspects  of change management, leadership and coaching are touched. Real-life examples from Ericsson Finland: team formation and operation (managers and coaches role), Change Roadmap, coaching Leadership Teams, different levels of coaching (individuals, teams, PO, portfolio, line management on different levels). What is required from a management coach? How to get involvement? Why Scrum was seen as a threat for managers? How to involve people to change managers?"

    title: "Mikado Method"
    about: "A code base must be changed, or it will die. But sometimes these changes feels like a fight with the Legacy Software Hydra, for every scary head cut off, two more grows out. Every change takes us further from the goal! Instead, come learn the Mikado Method, a systematic approach to beat the Hydra and change the code in a safe way. It enables continuous delivery, and it enhances team communication, collaboration and learning, helping individuals stay on track. We will practice to visualize, prepare and perform business-value-focused changes, without having a broken code-base in the process. Process/Mechanics: Participants sharing code change horror stories to get in the mood; The horror story behind the Mikado Method, and the resolution; The core concepts to make it work, and the benefits of it; The Mikado Method kata in Java code (https://github.com/mikadomethod/kata-java), performed by presenter; Q&A/Debriefing. Participants perform same demo as a kata. Bring Your Own Laptop!! (Java and C# examples provided); Q&A/Debriefing.

At the time he didn’t know what kind of impact that particular book would have on him and the software industry. Fueled by many new thoughts he began his Agile journey which later led him to start a company specializing in XP and Scrum. In 2005 Ola started Agical with three colleagues, one of Sweden’s most prominent Agile coaching companies of today. As an expert in software developing skills such as TDD and Continuous Integration as well as more soft skills he coaches both developers and leaders while they are learning Agile practices and methods. Today he is working with clients that are working with or would like to be working with Agile methods. This often puts him in situations where he has to defend, promote and question the values and practices behind Agile which he has become very familiar with. Ola is also one of the driving forces behind ‘Agile Sweden’, Sweden’s biggest Agile network."

    title: "Product Management in Agile Organization with Product Developed by Many Teams"
    about: "Early in 2010 we implemented Scrum in Adform as its development process. More than 40 people were split to 6 cross functional teams. So what’s the big deal you will ask? The big deal for us was: we all work developing ONE product (SaS Ads Serving platform)! We are not working on separate projects! How to organize Product Management work to fit this? How 6 Product Owners should work together, with company management, and other departments? How to split big features and divide work to teams (usually one feature had to be implemented by few teams to bring value to the customer)? What to do with 'research' projects? How to handle the growth of the company (now we have more than 50 people and 8 teams)? In this presentation I will share our journey, as well as mistakes we made and lessons learned. If you are implementing Agile in organization or project with many teams working on one product - this presentation is for you."

    about: "Targets, rewards, motivational speeches, ranking, individual bonuses, and even punishments, are to this day common management practices to get results from the workers. Are they effective in getting us to do better work? The world famous consultant Dr W Edwards Deming, who was “the man who taught the Japanese, America and many other countries about quality”, created The Red Bead Experiment in 1982 to communicate his take on the subject. In this session we will run a version of the experiment that has been slightly adapted for software development by David P. Joyce. The experiment introduces many of Deming’s ideas about management, the principles of variation and statistical process control charts. And it is a humorous and fun experience for both participants and audience! After the experiment there will be a presentation followed by a group discussions on the learning points and how they can be related to software development and the management of software development teams."

    about: "Today, when good developers are as hard to find as honest politicians, we — the development teams — run the show. But increasingly, we're losing touch with the very thing that allows us to be successful. We're forgetting about how to make our (development) clients happy. More fundamentally, this means that we're losing touch with the end goal: to build products that have a high value, regardless of how they're developed. In this session i'll show you modern agile methodology called BDD and couple of accompanied tools, that will finally help you on the way to make well thought products."
